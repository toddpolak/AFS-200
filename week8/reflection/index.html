                <li>In this course you learned how to create  Django servers. Thinking about your Capstone project and other real-world scenarios, explain the importance of Django servers.</li>
                <li>Learning how to connect the Frontend (the website the User interacts with) to the Database (where the information is stored) with a Server is critical to becoming a Fullstack Engineer. Now that you’ve seen this critical piece of the Fullstack puzzle, what was hard, difficult, or surprising to you about Server Development, and why?</li>
                <li>Some developers like to focus strictly on Frontend dev, others on Backend dev; and there are those that like to work on the entire Fullstack. Thus far on your journey through this Bryan University Web Development program, you’ve gained quite a bit of experience on the Frontend. Now that you have gained some experience with Backend Development, do you like developing Servers more than creating React apps and working on the Frontend? Don’t worry, you have more time to consider your options, but depending on your objectives and career paths, it’s good to know there are many options available to you, and wise to start considering what it is that you enjoy doing. Discuss your thoughts on this topic.</li>

                    <li>Django is the best framework for web applications, as it allows developers to use modules for faster development. As a developer, you can make use of these modules to create apps, websites from an existing source. It speeds up the development process greatly, as you do not have to code everything from scratch.</li>
                    <li>Surprising to me about Server Development was how easy and convenient the setup process was. You are up and running in little time and there are lots of open-source resources that work with the environment.</li>
                    <li>I enjoy developing both the server (back-end) and the front-end of applications. I like fully understanding how the core of the application works. Once you have a solid backend, you can basically build any front-end around it. Getting a solid backend up and running then testing it with applications like Postman, allow you to feel confident in the foundation of the app so you can move on to solid front-end development with libraries/frameworks like React,Vue, Python and of course, Django!</li>
